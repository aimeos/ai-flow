The Aimeos web shop components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails or handling translations.

The ai-flow extension integrates Aimeos into the Flow framework and utilizes the native Flow components for content caching, logging messages, session handling and generating URLs.

If you are using the Flow framework, you don't have to install and set up the ai-flow extension yourself. Instead, use the [Aimeos Flow package](https://github.com/aimeos/aimeos-flow) to create a web shop within minutes.
